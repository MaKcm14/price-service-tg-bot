# Price Service Telegram Bot

Prices are so unstableâ€¦ You can't track them in every market.  
Trust this bot to do the job, and you'll forget about daily analysis.  

It integrates with the **Price Service Project**, making searches easier and more precise.  

---

**In brief:** *This service is a UI for the Price Service Project.*  

---

## Main Description  

The Telegram bot has several key functions:  

- **Best Price Search Mode**:  
  This mode helps you find products with the best prices across different markets.  

- **Favorites Mode**:  
  This mode allows you to manage your favorite products and interact with them (add and remove items).  

- **Tracking Mode**:  
  This mode enables time-based product searches, working as a notification system that provides search results every 24 hours.  

## How to Install and Start  

Since this service depends on **Price Service**, some additional steps are required to use the bot.  

For a simpler installation and setup process, refer to the [best-price-project-deployment](https://github.com/MaKcm14/best-price-project-deployment) guide.  

## Configuring the .env

To start the bot, create a **.env** file in the root of the source directory with the structure as in the **.env_example** 

or **copy the .env_default into the .env with your_bot_token**.

The **.env_default** already configured for using.

You can customize your .env files according to your infrastructure.

### Note
Some changes in the .env file can lead to the necessity of changes in the main docker-compose files of deployment.
